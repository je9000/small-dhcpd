# small-dhcpd
An ancient dhcpd that runs perl scripts for the dhcp logic.

The primary platform for this was Windows, but I believe it
compiled on FreeBSD too. I'm not sure if any of it works
anymore, but I want to keep the code around in case I ever
need a custom DHCP server again.

BSD licensed unless the file says otherwise.
